		description: "I worked with a team of 15 people to create AR simulations for illustrations from NCERT books (Grade 9 & 10). We conceptualized ideas about how we could develop interactive simulations for the 2D illustrations shown. We worked in pairs to complete each simulation which involved creating 3D assets on Blender and coding in C# on the Unity Game Engine to provide interactivity.",
