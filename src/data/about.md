# intro

I'll be graduating from IIITD in about a year. Throughout my journey, I have always been a curious student and an enthusiastic learner. I love the dynamic and the ever-evolving nature of the computer science field; there is always something to explore or learn. Recently, I started exploring different fields in Computer Science to find something that interests me. I took up courses from various fields like Data Science, Machine Learning, Computer Security, etc.  

I like challenges and coming up with creative solutions to problems. (Have a problem that you would like to discuss? [Hit me up](mailto:prashansatanwar@gmail.com) :P)

# Currently

I'm working towards finishing my graduation. I'm a **permanent resident of Singapore**. I plan to settle in Singapore right after my graduation. With my newfound interest in Data Science, I'm working on some projects to further my understanding of the subject and gain experience in tools currently used in the industry.
