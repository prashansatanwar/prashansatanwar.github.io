# intro

I'm a recent graduate from Indraprastha Insitute of Information Technology, Delhi. Throughout my journey, I've always been a curious student and an enthusiastic learner. I like the dynamic nature of the computer science field; there is always something to explore or learn. Recently, I started exploring different areas in Computer Science to find something that interests me. 

I like to bring a positive attitude to the table and find creative solutions to the challenges that come forth.

I like to spend my time around nature, going on walks or running. When I'm not outside, I usually read books, practice yoga, or do any sort of art. You can find my art [here](https://www.instagram.com/ps_palette/)
